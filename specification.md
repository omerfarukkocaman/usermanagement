   - Default filter is "All Roles."
   - Search bar is empty.

2. **Search:**

3. **Filter:**

   - Changing the filter dropdown updates the table to display users with the selected role.

7. **Pagination:**

   - Updates the user list to reflect the selected page or limit.

## Error Handling

1. If the user list fails to load, display an error message: "Unable to load users. Please try again later."
2. For form validation errors, display messages inline for each field.
3. If a user fails to be added, edited, or deleted, display a toast notification with the error.

## Accessibility

1. Ensure all buttons and inputs have ARIA labels.
2. Keyboard navigation should work for all interactive elements.
3. Contrast ratio for text and background should meet WCAG 2.1 standards.
